   answers to a file named `answers.pdf`.



1. **Algorithmic Paradigms**

My favorite algorithm paradigm would be **Dynamic Programming**.

I really liked its versatility and how the same basic pattern is applicable to so many different types of problems throughout all the modules we studied in the later half of the semester.

What appealed the most was to me the recurring structural pattern:

1. **Optimal substructure**: Expressing and breaking down the problem as a recurrence on optimal solutions to smaller sub-problems, for e.g. OPT(n,W) for the 0-1 Knapsack problem.
2. **Overlapping sub-problems + memoization**: Instead of doing the recursion with same state exponentially many times, the "answers" to these states can be memoized potentially turning an exponential brute force search algorithm into a more efficient polynomial-time one.

I enjoyed writing down the recurrences and identifying the rights because once that is done, the algorithm feels almost like its "self writing": the recursion and memoization follow quite systematically from the formulation.

Dynamic Programming (DP) also looks very simple on the surface, but it captures a lot of complex logic in a very structured way. It also connects quite nicely to the cost models and work span analysis: Not only are these solutions more efficient, but are often easier to reason about and can sometimes even be parallelized by filling the table in a structured way.
